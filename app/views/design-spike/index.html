      <p><strong>Iteration focus: Improving application management for recruiters</strong></p>
      <p>This iteration introduces enhancements to the recruiter journey to improve the management of volunteer applications. Key updates include:</p>
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li><strong>Sorting & Filtering</strong> – Recruiters can now sort applications by date and filter by status (e.g., New, Reviewed, Shortlisted).</li>
        <li><strong>Bulk actions</strong> – Ability to select multiple applications and archive or delete them at once.</li>
        <li><strong>Confirmation steps</strong> – Added confirmation pages for approving, rejecting, and deleting applications to prevent accidental actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Application status & Visibility</strong> – New/unread applications are highlighted, and archived applications can be toggled on/off.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion rules</strong> – Applications must be reviewed before they can be deleted, ensuring proper processing.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These changes aim to streamline the recruitment process, reduce time spent managing applications, and provide greater transparency in volunteer onboarding.</p>

      </ul>
  
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-s">How do recruiters currently handle bulk actions (approving, rejecting, deleting)?</h2>
      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Do they need better ways to archive or remove applications?</li>
        <li>How do they decide when to delete an application?</li>

      <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
        <li>Would sorting, filtering, or bulk actions help streamline their workflow?</li>
        <li>How do they feel about the new confirmation steps for approval, rejection, and deletion?</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-s">Key research outcome</h2>
      <p>The research will help identify friction points in application management and validate whether the proposed sorting, filtering, bulk actions, and confirmation pages improve the recruiter experience.</p>
