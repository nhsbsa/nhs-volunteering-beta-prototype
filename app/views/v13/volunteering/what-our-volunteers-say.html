          ways and for different reasons.</p>

        <p class="nhsuk-body">We have asked them about their experience of volunteering within the NHS.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="nhsuk-card__description__meet-vols">
              <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>Why I volunteer:</strong> I signed up to volunteer because I love gardening
                but I live in an apartment.
              <p class="nhsuk-body">My fellow gardeners are people I probably wouldn't have met and I really enjoy their
                company. My physical and mental health benefit far more than I imagined they would. Working in a garden
                is very satisfying because we get to see the fruits of our labour and we get to see the positive impact
                it has for the patients.</p>
              <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>My typical day:</strong> I meet the other two gardeners for a quick cup of
                tea before we start. A typical session is about two hours. The patients like to interact so there is
                often an opportunity to draw on their knowledge and experience to inform our focus in the garden.</p>
              <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>Why you should consider it too:</strong> I find volunteering gives me
                personal satisfaction far more than merely donating to causes. It really is great to do something small
                but see the impact it can have on others. </p>

              <div class="nhsuk-card__description__meet-vols">
                <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>Why I volunteer:</strong> I started volunteering to get experience for my
                  degree, but I have enjoyed having thoughtful conversations with patients.</p>
                <p class="nhsuk-body">I like the rewarding feeling of knowing I am making a different to their
                  experience. Volunteering has given me the opportunity to work in a multidisciplinary team and I am
                  able to learn by observing doctors and nurses.</p>
                <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>My typical day:</strong> I provide companionship to young mental health
                  patients waiting in the emergency department. I also look after their parents by providing drinks
                  while they are waiting for staff to see their kids.</p>
                <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>Why you should consider it too:</strong> It only takes a few hours of your
                  week to give back to the community. It increases your confidence in meeting a range of different
                  people from different backgrounds. You'll learn something new everyday. </p>
