          <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>Volunteers at:</strong> a community mental health hospital in Greenwich <br> <strong>As a:</strong> gardening volunteer<br> <strong>From:</strong> May 2023</p>
        </div>
        <div class="nhsuk-card__description__meet-vols">
          <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>Why I volunteer:</strong>  I signed up to volunteer because I love gardening but live in an apartment. 
            <p class="nhsuk-body">My fellow gardeners are people I probably wouldn't have met and I really enjoy their company. My physical and mental health benefit far more than I imagined they would. Working in a garden is very satisfying because we get to see the fruits of our labour and we get to see the positive impact it has for the patients.</p>
            <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>My typical day:</strong> I volunteer with two other volunteers to maintain the garden. We meet for a quick cup of tea first. A typical session is about two hours. The patients like to interact so there is often an opportunity to draw on their knowledge and experience to inform our focus in the garden.</p>
            <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>My one advice to you is:</strong> I find volunteering gives me personal satisfaction far more than merely donating to causes. It really great to do something small but see the impact it can have on others. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="nhsuk-card__description__meet-vols"> 
          <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>Why I volunteer:</strong>   I started volunteering to get experience for my degree, but I have enjoyed having thoughtful conversations with patients.</p>
          <p class="nhsuk-body">I like the rewarding feeling of knowing I am making a different to their experience. Volunteering has given me the opportunity to work in a multidisciplinary team and I am able to learn by observing doctors and nurses.</p>
          <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>My typical day:</strong> I provide companionship to young mental health patients waiting in the emergency department. I also look after their parents by providing drinks while they are waiting for staff to see their kids.</p>
          <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>My one advice to you is:</strong> Only take a few hours of your day a week to give back to the community. It increases your confidence in meeting a range of different people from different backgrounds. You'll learn something new everyday. </p>

        <div class="nhsuk-card__description__meet-vols">
          <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>Why I volunteer:</strong>  As a butterfly volunteer, I support patients as they prepare to face the last stage of their lives. No one should die alone. For the patient, it can be quite a frightening time. </p>
          <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>My typical day:</strong> I sit with patients who are in their last days/hours of life so they are not alone. I let nurses know of any changes in their condition. I may read, play gentle music or just sit quietly holding their hand. I also give respite for families who need a break, making them a drink or sorting out free parking for them.</p>
          <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>My one advice to you is:</strong> volunteers are greatly needed and very valued. You would be giving something back, which in itself is rewarding.  </p>
