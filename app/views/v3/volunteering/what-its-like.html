              <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>Why I volunteer:</strong>  I signed up to volunteer because I love gardening but I live in an apartment. 
                <p class="nhsuk-body">My fellow gardeners are people I probably wouldn't have met and I really enjoy their company. My physical and mental health benefit far more than I imagined they would. Working in a garden is very satisfying because we get to see the fruits of our labour and we get to see the positive impact it has for the patients.</p>
                <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>My typical day:</strong> I meet the other two gardeners for a quick cup of tea before we start.  A typical session is about two hours. The patients like to interact so there is often an opportunity to draw on their knowledge and experience to inform our focus in the garden.</p>
                <p class="nhsuk-body"><strong>Why you should consider it too:</strong> I find volunteering gives me personal satisfaction far more than merely donating to causes. It really is great to do something small but see the impact it can have on others. </p>
