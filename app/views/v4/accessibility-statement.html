  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Enforcement procedure</h2>
  <p>The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018 (the ‘accessibility regulations’).</p>
  <p>If you’re not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact <a href="https://www.equalityadvisoryservice.com/app/ask" target="_blank" class="nhsuk-link">the Equality Advisory and Support Service (EASS)(opens in a new tab)</a>.</p>


  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Contact us</h2>
  <p>For queries not related to accessibility, you can email the NHS Volunteering team at <a href="mailto:nhsvolunteering@nhsbsa.nhs.uk" class=“Your NHS Volunteering query”>nhsvolunteering@nhsbsa.nhs.uk</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Technical information about this website’s accessibility</h2>
  <p>NHSBSA is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>


  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Compliance status</h2>
  <p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21" target="_blank" class=“https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21”>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard (opens in a new tab)</a>, due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below.</p>

  <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Non-accessible content</h3>
  <p>We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p>
  <ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
  <li>pending accessibility report [INSERT]</li>
  <li>pending accessibility report [INSERT]</li>
  <li>pending accessibility report [INSERT]</li>
</ul>
  <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Disproportionate burden</h2>
  <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Navigation and accessing information</h3>
  <p>There’s no way to skip the repeated content in the page header (for example, a 'skip to main content' option).</p>
  <p>It’s not always possible to change the device orientation from horizontal to vertical without making it more difficult to view the content.</p>
  <p>It’s not possible for users to change text size without some of the content overlapping.</p>

  <h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Interactive tools and transactions</h3>
  <p>Some of our interactive forms are difficult to navigate using a keyboard. For example, because some form controls are missing a 'label' tag.</p>
  <p>Our forms are built and hosted through third party software and 'skinned' to look like our website.</p>
  <p>We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information, and with interactive tools and transactions. We believe that doing so now would be a <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made" target="_blank" class="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made">disproportionate burden (opens in a new tab)</a> within the meaning of the accessibility regulations.</p>
  <p>We will make another assessment when the supplier contract is up for renewal, likely to be in the next twelve months.</p>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">What we are doing to improve accessibility</h2>
  <p>We’re committed to making sure this website is compliant to WCAG 2.1 AA standard. </p>
  <p>Our accessibility compliance statement will be reviewed every 6 months. Every new released website will be designed, built and tested to meet 'AA' standards by default.</p>

  <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
  <p>This statement was prepared on 10 October 2023. It was last reviewed on 24 January 2024.</p>
  <p>This website was last accessibility tested on [ADD DATE] by KAINOS Ltd.</p>
  <p>We tested all of the website screens to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards, using manual and automated tests.</p>
  <p>We run each webpage through automated Wave, Lighthouse and Axe accessibility tools and then manually test with screen readers (VoiceOver) and standards checklists.</p>
  <p>The checklists contain standards that have been compiled using WCAG, NHS service manual and Government Digital Service (GDS) guidance.</p>
