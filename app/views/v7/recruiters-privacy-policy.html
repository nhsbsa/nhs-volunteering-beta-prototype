<h1 class="nhsuk-heading-xl">NHS Volunteering Privacy Policy</h1>
<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Privacy policy</h2>

<p>This service (“NHS Volunteering”) is run by the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) on behalf of NHS England. NHS England will be referred to as 'we' and 'us' from now on.</p>
<p>The NHS Volunteering service provides people with information on volunteering opportunities in the health and social care sector.</p>
<p>Volunteering opportunities are listed on NHS Volunteering by:</p>
<ul class="nhsuk-list nhsuk-list--bullet">
  <li>NHS organisations</li>
  <li>voluntary, community or social enterprise (VCSE) organisations working with the NHS</li>
</ul>
<p>These will be referred to as recruiting organisations from now on.</p>

<h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Acting on behalf of a recruiting organisation</h3>
<p>If you are acting for or on behalf of a recruiting organisation then please read the <a href="recruiters-terms-conditions">terms and conditions for recruiting organisations</a>. This will explain your and your organisation's obligations. Please also read our <a href="cookies">cookie policy for recruiters</a>.</p>
<p>Some recruiting organisations will provide a link to a third party website which you need to follow to apply. This will take you outside of NHS Volunteering.</p>
<p>If you have questions about a volunteering opportunity or an application, you should contact the recruiting organisation.</p> 

<h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Data controllers and data processors</h3>
<p>As data controller NHS England is responsible for how your personal information is used, kept, and shared. NHSBSA acts as a data processor for NHS England operating as instructed by NHS England.</p>

<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">What information the service collects</h2>
<p>In order to run an effective service we need to collect information about prospective volunteers and recruiting organisations.</p>

<h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Prospective volunteers</h3>
<p>As a prospective volunteer the personal data we collect from you includes:</p>

  <li>the details of which device and version of web browser you used</li>
  <li>information on how you use the site <a href="cookies">using cookies</a> and page tagging techniques</li>
