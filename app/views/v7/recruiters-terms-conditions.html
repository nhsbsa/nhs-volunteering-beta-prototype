<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-l">Data protection</h2>
<p>As part NHS Volunteering personal data is shared between NHS England and the Recruiting Organisation. This supports the recruitment of new Volunteers into the NHS and partner Recruiting Organisations.</p>

  <li>progressing prospective volunteer applicants</li>
  <li>communicating with volunteer applicants</li>
  <li>considering the needs and preferences of volunteer applicants</li>
</ul>
<p>This data sharing will support a high-quality volunteer recruitment experience. The personal data shared should form the basis of a volunteer record held locally in line with your own records retention schedule.</p>

<h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Data compliance and responsibilities</h3>
<p>When providing and using NHS Volunteering, NHS England and Recruiting Organisations are each responsible for their own compliance with the applicable Data Protection Legislation.</p>
<p>Data sharing only takes place when Recruiting Organisations opt to receive Applicant Data from NHS England which is submitted via NHS Volunteering.</p>
<p>This does not apply to Recruiting Organisations who use the NHS Volunteering website solely to direct applicants to their own volunteer vacancies’ page or application process, or those who use third party application systems.</p>

<h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Roles and responsibilities of the parties</h3>
<p>NHS England and the Recruiting Organisation are independent Data Controllers in relation to Personal Data shared via the NHS Volunteering website. Both parties agree to comply with their obligations as a Controller under the Data Protection Legislation and agree not to do anything which will cause the other to breach their Data Protection Legislation obligations. </p>
<p>NHSBSA is a data Processor of NHS England in respect of Personal Data submitted by a Volunteer prior to their application being submitted to the Recruiting Organisation and is not party to the data sharing obligations set out in this section. Reference to “parties” within this section therefore relate to NHS England and the Recruiting Organisation.</p>
<p>Details of the Personal Data shared between the parties and the Agreed Purpose of the data sharing is set out the table entitled “Data Sharing Activities” below.  Both parties agree that Personal Data is only to be shared where it is necessary to perform obligations contained in these Terms and Conditions, where it is required in compliance with the Data Protection Legislation, or where it is necessary for the Agreed Purpose. Both parties agree that they will Process the shared Personal Data only in relation to the Agreed Purpose and in accordance with these Terms and Conditions.</p>
<p>Where one party has provided Personal Data to the other party, the recipient of the Personal Data will provide copies of all relevant documents and information relating to its data protection policies and procedures as the other Party may reasonably require. Links to NHS England’s relevant documents are provided above. </p>

<h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Compliance with GDPR when sharing data</h3>
<p>The parties are responsible for their own compliance with Articles 13 and 14 of UK GDPR (Transparency) in respect of their Processing activities. You must include a link to your organisation's privacy policy on your volunteering opportunity listings. This must make Volunteers aware of your Processing of their Personal Data and your data retention policy. Please see our <a href="recruiters-privacy-policy"privacy policy></a> for details of how we process both Volunteers’ and Recruiting Organisation staff data.</p>
<p>When Processing shared Personal Data, each party agrees to:</p>
<p>(a) implement and maintain appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to that risk, including, as appropriate, the measures referred to in Article 32(1)(a), (b), (c) and (d) of the UK GDPR;</p>
<p>(b) ensure that employees who have access to the shared Personal Data have undergone training in the Data Protection Legislation and in the care and handling of Personal Data; </p>
<p>(c) not disclose Personal Data to any third party in any circumstances except as required or permitted by these Terms and Conditions; and </p>
<p>(d) notify the other party promptly of any known breach of technical and organisational security measures where the breach has affected or could have affected Personal Data transferred. </p>
<p>Each party will promptly notify the other party if it becomes aware of any Personal Data Breach relating to Personal Data shared for the Agreed Purposes and shall:</p>
<p>(a) do anything which is reasonably necessary to assist the other party in mitigating the effects of the Personal Data Breach;</p>
<p>(b) implement any measures necessary to restore the security of any compromised Personal Data;</p>
<p>(c) work with the other party to make any required notifications to the Information Commissioner’s Office and affected Data Subjects in accordance with the Data Protection Legislation (including the relevant timeframes); and</p>
<p>(d) not do anything which may damage the reputation of the other party or that party's relationship with the relevant Data Subjects, save as required by Law.</p>

<h3 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Maintaining processing activities</h3>
<p>Each party shall maintain a record of its Processing activities in accordance with Article 30 UK GDPR.</p>
<p>Where a party receives a request by a Data Subject to exercise any of their rights under the Data Protection Legislation (including access to information), the other party shall provide information and/or assistance as reasonably requested by the receiving party to help it respond to the request. Or, where a request is directed to the other party and/or relates to the other party's Processing of the Personal Data, the receiving party will promptly inform the other party that it has received the request and shall forward it to the other party, and provide any information and/or assistance as reasonably requested by the other Party to help it respond to the request in the timeframes specified by Data Protection Legislation.</p>
<p>Any material breach of the Data Protection Legislation or the terms set out in these Terms and Conditions shall permit NHS England to terminate the Recruiting Organisation’s involvement with NHS Volunteering and access to the service.</p>
<p>The parties acknowledge that the use of the NHS Volunteering Website is subject to the terms of these Terms and Conditions, as amended from time to time. These may be updated to reflect changes in the Processing activities and/or the obligations on the parties. The parties shall ensure they keep up to date with any such changes, which will be communicated in the form of revised Terms and Conditions.</p>
