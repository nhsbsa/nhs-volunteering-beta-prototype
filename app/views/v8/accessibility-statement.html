            This accessibility statement applies to the NHS Volunteering website.
          </p>
          <p class="nhsuk-body">
            This website is run by the NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA). We want as many people as
            possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:
          </p>
          <ul class="nhsuk-list  nhsuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
              change colours, contrast levels and fonts using browser or device settings
            </li>
            <li>
              zoom in up to 400% without the text spilling off the screen
            </li>
            <li>
              navigate most of the website using just a keyboard or speech recognition software 
              (Voice Control and Dragon)
            </li>
            <li>
              listen to most of the website using a screen reader 
              (including the most recent version of NVDA and VoiceOver)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="nhsuk-body">
            We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

            How accessible this website is

            We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible, as:

          <ul class="nhsuk-list  nhsuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
              when the page is zoomed in beyond 110%, the NHS Volunteering logo overlaps with the 'Skip to main content' link on all pages

            <li>
              some pages have underlined expanders and redundant links
            </li>
            <li>
              pages and buttons are not visible in 'Reader view' in Safari (should this be some pages and buttons??)
            </li>
            <li>
              on some screens, people using screen readers might find it difficult to understand what the text boxes are for
            </li>
            <li>
              on the search for an opportunity results page, people using screen readers might find difficult to understand the context of multiple organisation links
            </li>
            <li>
              on some pages, form fields are not labelled with clear description

            <li>
              screen readers are reading images that are only meant for decoration
            </li>
            <li>
              a button labelled 'Hide' appears after choosing cookie settings, but it’s unclear what it will hide, which makes it harder for screen reader users to understand its purpose

            We run representative user journey tests through speech recognition software (Dragon and Voice Control).
